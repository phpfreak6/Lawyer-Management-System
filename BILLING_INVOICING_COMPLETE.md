## 💰 Invoice Calculation

### Formula:
```
Subtotal = (Billable Hours × Hourly Rate) + Expenses
GST Amount = Subtotal × (GST Percentage / 100)
Total Amount = Subtotal + GST Amount
```

### Example:
```
Billable Hours: 10 hrs
Hourly Rate: ₹500/hr
Subtotal (Hours): ₹5,000

Expenses: ₹1,500
Subtotal: ₹6,500

GST (18%): ₹1,170
Total Amount: ₹7,670
```

## 🎯 Payment Status

### Three Status Levels:
1. **Pending** (Orange) - No payment received
2. **Partial** (Blue) - Partial payment received
3. **Paid** (Green) - Full payment received

### Automatic Status Calculation:
```javascript
if (paid_amount >= total_amount) {
  status = 'paid'
} else if (paid_amount > 0) {
  status = 'partial'
} else {
  status = 'pending'
}
```
