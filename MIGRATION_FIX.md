# Migration Fix Applied

## Problem
The database migration was failing with error:
```
Error: Duplicate key name 'idx_users_tenant_id'
```

This occurred because MySQL was trying to create indexes that already existed from previous migrations.

## Solution
Modified the migration script (`backend/migrations/migrate.js`) to gracefully handle duplicate index errors by:

1. **Adding error handling** - The script now catches and ignores specific MySQL errors:
   - `ER_DUP_KEYNAME` - Duplicate index names
   - `ER_DUP_ENTRY` - Duplicate entries
   - `ER_TABLE_EXISTS_ERROR` - Tables that already exist

2. **Making migration idempotent** - The migration can now be run multiple times safely without failing.

3. **Updated tenant insertion** - Changed `INSERT` to `INSERT IGNORE` to prevent duplicate tenant errors.

## Files Modified
1. `backend/migrations/migrate.js` - Added error handling wrapper
2. `backend/migrations/01_schema.sql` - Changed to `INSERT IGNORE` for default tenant

## Result
✅ Migration now runs successfully and shows warnings for existing indexes:
```
⚠️  Skipping: Duplicate key name 'idx_users_tenant_id'
⚠️  Skipping: Duplicate key name 'idx_clients_tenant_id'
...
✓ Migration completed successfully
```

## Testing
Migration can be safely run multiple times:
```bash
cd backend
npm run migrate
npm run seed
```

The migration now proceeds even if tables/indexes already exist, making it safe for re-running during development.
